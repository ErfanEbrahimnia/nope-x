# Nope-X

![Preview](preview.gif)

A browser extension that adds a "Nope" button to every post on 𝕏, allowing you to clean up your timeline with a single click.

## Why I Built It

I was tired of 𝕏 bombarding me with political noise and irrelevant content. This extension provides an easy way to let the algorithm know what you’re not interested in.

## Installation

### Default way

You can install the extension from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/nope-x/ccdjdfigimnakjepeiemjhfjeekklhaa)

### From source

1. **Download the Code**: Click the green "Code" button on GitHub and select "Download ZIP".
2. **Load the Extension**: Follow [this guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/hello-world#load-unpacked) to load the unpacked `extension` folder in your browser's developer mode.
3. **Use It**: Visit 𝕏 and start cleaning up your timeline
